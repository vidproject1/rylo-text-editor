## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### Technical Risks
- **Electron Memory Usage**: Monitor and optimize regularly
- **File Handling Edge Cases**: Comprehensive testing with various file types and sizes
- **Command Parser Complexity**: Keep parser simple and well-documented
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Test early and often on all target platforms

### UX Risks
- **Keyboard-Only Usability**: Extensive user testing with keyboard-only workflows
- **Learning Curve**: Comprehensive help system and intuitive command design
- **Performance Perception**: Focus on startup time and responsiveness
